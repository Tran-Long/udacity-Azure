- Problem 2:
	+) Description: The object detection model of Azure Custom Vision cannot achieve 75% precision with provided training images. Moreover, the model cannot detect lighter in test images as well 
	+) Solution: I tried to collect more domain-specific lighter images on the internet, about 20 more. The model performance is better (achieve 75% with threshold 95%), and it can detect lighter in some test images.
